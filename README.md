## Binary Encoder/Decoder

This is a Python script that allows you to encode and decode text into binary code. It provides a simple command-line interface for easy interaction. 

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the script file.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python BinaryCodec.py
   ```

5. The script will display a welcome message and present you with a menu of options:

   ```plaintext
    ____  _                         ____          _
   | __ )(_)_ __   __ _ _ __ _   _ / ___|___   __| | ___  ___
   |  _ \| | '_ \ / _` | '__| | | | |   / _ \ / _` |/ _ \/ __|
   | |_) | | | | | (_| | |  | |_| | |__| (_) | (_| |  __/ (__
   |____/|_|_| |_|\__,_|_|   \__, |\____\___/ \__,_|\___|\___|
                             |___/

   Select an option:
   1. Encode text
   2. Decode binary
   3. Exit

   Enter your choice:

6. To encode text, choose option 1. You will be prompted to enter the text you want to encode. After entering the text, the script will display the encoded binary code.

7. To decode binary, choose option 2. You will be prompted to enter the binary code you want to decode. After entering the code, the script will display the decoded text.

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 as needed. To exit the script, choose option 3.

### Example

Here's an example of how the script works:

1. Encode text
2. Decode binary
3. Exit

Enter your choice: 1
Enter text to be encoded: Hello
Encoded binary code: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111

Select an option:
1. Encode text
2. Decode binary
3. Exit

Enter your choice: 2
Enter binary code to be decoded: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111
Decoded text: Hello

Select an option:
1. Encode text
2. Decode binary
3. Exit

Enter your choice: 3
